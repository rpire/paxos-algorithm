# Paxos Algorithm

This coding challenge is part of the recruitment process at [Meeteam](https://meeteam.co). The task consists on simulating a distributed system and implementing a consensus algorithm (in this case, Paxos) to achieve to ensure all nodes agree on the shared state.

## Built With

- Ruby
